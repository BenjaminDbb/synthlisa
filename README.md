This is Synthetic LISA, an open-source software package to simulate the LISA science process at the level of scientific and technical requirements.

However, I have just imported my private SVN archive to github, and I really need to scrub it.

Dependencies:

* [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org) (of course): `pip install numpy`
* [SWIG](http://www.swig.org)
* [pyRXP](http://www.reportlab.com/software/opensource/pyrxp/): `pip install http://svn.reportlab.com/svn/public/pyRXP/trunk/src`
